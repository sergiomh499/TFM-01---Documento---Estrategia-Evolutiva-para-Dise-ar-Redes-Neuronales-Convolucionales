abstract = {Robotic weed control has seen increased research of late with its potential for boosting productivity in agriculture. Majority of works focus on developing robotics for croplands, ignoring the weed management problems facing rangeland stock farmers. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to widespread uptake of robotic weed control is the robust classification of weed species in their natural environment. The unparalleled successes of deep learning make it an ideal candidate for recognising various weed species in the complex rangeland environment. This work contributes the first large, public, multiclass image dataset of weed species from the Australian rangelands; allowing for the development of robust classification methods to make robotic weed control viable. The DeepWeeds dataset consists of 17,509 labelled images of eight nationally significant weed species native to eight locations across northern Australia. This paper presents a baseline for classification performance on the dataset using the benchmark deep learning models, Inception-v3 and ResNet-50. These models achieved an average classification accuracy of 95.1\% and 95.7\%, respectively. We also demonstrate real time performance of the ResNet-50 architecture, with an average inference time of 53.4 ms per image. These strong results bode well for future field implementation of robotic weed control methods in the Australian rangelands.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks are designed to work with grid-structured inputs, which have strong spatial dependencies in local regions of the grid. The most obvious example of grid-structured data is a 2-dimensional image. This type of data also exhibits spatial dependencies, because adjacent spatial locations in an image often have similar color values of the individual pixels. An additional dimension captures the different colors, which creates a 3-dimensional input volume. Therefore, the features in a convolutional neural network have dependencies among one another based on spatial distances.Convolutional Neural Networks},

abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

@article{Alzubaidi2021,
abstract = {In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.},

The exact criterion used for validation-based early stopping, however, is usually chosen in an ad-hoc fashion or training is stopped interactively. This trick describes how to select a stopping criterion in a systematic fashion; it is a trick for either speeding learning procedures or improving generalization, whichever is more important in the particular situation. An empirical investigation on multi-layer perceptrons shows that there exists a tradeoff between training time and generalization: From the given mix of 1296 training runs using difierent 12 problems and 24 difierent network architectures I conclude slower stopping criteria allow for small improvements in generalization (here: about 4{\%} on average), but cost much more training time (here: about factor 4 longer on average).},

abstract = {A momentum term is usually included in the simulations of connectionist learning algorithms. Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.},

abstract = {The accurate detection and treatment of weeds in agricultural fields is a necessary procedure for managing crop yield and avoiding herbicide pollution. With the emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), the ability to acquire spatial data at the desired spatial and temporal resolution became available, and the resulting input data met high standards for weed management. In this paper, we tested four independent classification algorithms for the creation of weed maps, combining automatic and manual methods, as well as object-based and pixel-based classification approaches, which were used separately on two subsets. Input UAV data were collected using a low-cost RGB camera due to its affordability compared to multispectral cameras. Classification algorithms were based on the random forest machine learning algorithm for weed and bare soil extraction, following an unsupervised classification with the K-means algorithm for further estimation of weeds and bare soil presence in non-weed and non-soil areas. Of the four classification algorithms tested, the automatic object-based classification method achieved the highest classification accuracy, resulting in an overall accuracy of 89.0\% for subset A and 87.1\% for subset B. Automatic classification methods were robustly developed, using at least 0.25\% of the scene size as the training data set in all circumstances anticipated for the random forest classification algorithm to operate. The use of the algorithm resulted in weed maps consisting of zoned classes and covering areas with similar biological properties, making them ready for use as inputs in weed treatments that use agricultural machinery.},

abstract = {Weeds can be major environmental and economic burdens in New Zealand. Traditional methods of weed control including manual and chemical approaches can be time consuming and costly. Some chemical herbicides may have negative environmental and human health impacts. One of the proposed important steps for providing alternatives to these traditional approaches is the automated identification and mapping of weeds. We used hyperspectral imaging data and machine learning to explore the possibility of fast, accurate and automated discrimination of weeds in pastures where ryegrass and clovers are the sown species. Hyperspectral images from two grasses (Setaria pumila [yellow bristle grass] and Stipa arundinacea [wind grass]) and two broad leaf weed species (Ranunculus acris [giant buttercup] and Cirsium arvense [Californian thistle]) were acquired and pre-processed using the standard normal variate method. We trained three classification models, namely partial least squares-discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using whole plant averaged (Av) spectra and superpixels (Sp) averaged spectra from each weed sample. All three classification models showed repeatable identification of four weeds using both Av and Sp spectra with a range of overall accuracy of 70–100\%. However, MLP based on the Sp method produced the most reliable and robust prediction result (89.1\% accuracy). Four significant spectral regions were found as highly informative for characterizing the four weed species and could form the basis for a rapid and efficient methodology for identifying weeds in ryegrass/clover pastures.},

@article{Westwood2018,
abstract = {The discipline of weed science is at a critical juncture. Decades of efficient chemical weed control have led to a rise in the number of herbicide-resistant weed populations, with few new herbicides with unique modes of action to counter this trend and often no economical alternatives to herbicides in large-acreage crops. At the same time, the world population is swelling, necessitating increased food production to feed an anticipated 9 billion people by the year 2050. Here, we consider these challenges along with emerging trends in technology and innovation that offer hope of providing sustainable weed management into the future. The emergence of natural product leads in discovery of new herbicides and biopesticides suggests that new modes of action can be discovered, while genetic engineering provides additional options for manipulating herbicide selectivity and creating entirely novel approaches to weed management. Advances in understanding plant pathogen interactions will contribute to developing new biological control agents, and insights into plant-plant interactions suggest that crops can be improved by manipulating their response to competition. Revolutions in computing power and automation have led to a nascent industry built on using machine vision and global positioning system information to distinguish weeds from crops and deliver precision weed control. These technologies open multiple possibilities for efficient weed management, whether through chemical or mechanical mechanisms. Information is also needed by growers to make good decisions, and will be delivered with unprecedented efficiency and specificity, potentially revolutionizing aspects of extension work. We consider that meeting the weed management needs of agriculture by 2050 and beyond is a challenge that requires commitment by funding agencies, researchers, and students to translate new technologies into durable weed management solutions. Integrating old and new weed management technologies into more diverse weed management systems based on a better understanding of weed biology and ecology can provide integrated weed management and resistance management strategies that will be more sustainable than the technologies that are now failing. },

Managing weeds on a subfield level requires measuring the varying density of weeds within a field. Decision models aid in the selection and adjustment of the treatments, depending on the weed infestation. The weed control can be done either with herbicides or mechanically. A site-specific herbicide application technology can save large amounts of herbicides. Mechanical weed control techniques adapting to the weed situation in the field are applicable to a wide spectrum of crops.},

@article{RUIZ2006,
abstract = {Summary The abundance of Avena sterilis in dryland barley fields was studied in four Spanish provinces. During two growing seasons, differential geopositioning system (DGPS)-geo-referenced A. sterilis infestations were obtained in 31 fields. The majority of the infestations were concentrated in few large but irregularly shaped patches, with a higher number of smaller and more regular patches accounting for a small proportion of the infestation. A multitude of very small and irregular patches completed the inventory. The implications of this spatial structure were studied. Site-specific adjusted-dose herbicide application offered 61.74\% potential herbicide savings. However, given the low levels of infestation and the low economic returns obtained in most of the provinces, the most profitable strategy was generally no herbicide application. Site-specific treatments were advantageous only in high-returns systems. Because few large patches provided the majority of the infestation, zone-specific treatments would be advisable, until such time that weed detection and site-specific application technologies become more efficient.},

@article{Robert2002,
abstract = {Precision agriculture was initiated in the mid 1980s, using newly available technologies, to improve the application of fertilizers by varying rates and blends as needed within fields. Presently, the concept has been adapted to a variety of practices, crops, and countries. Its adoption varies significantly by cropping system, regions, and countries but it is progressively introduced or evaluated around the world. Several types of challenges limit a broader adoption: socio-economical, agronomical, and technological. Socio-economical barriers are principally costs and lack of skills. Agronomical challenges are lack of basic information, inadequate sampling and scouting procedures, absence of site-specific fertilizer recommendations, misuse of information, and lack of qualified agronomic services. There are multiple technological barriers that relate to machinery, sensor, GPS, software, and remote sensing. However, these barriers will be progressively lifted and precision agriculture will be a significant component of the agricultural system of the future. It offers a variety of potential benefits in profitability, productivity, sustainability, crop quality, food safety, environmental protection, on-farm quality of life, and rural economic development.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},
